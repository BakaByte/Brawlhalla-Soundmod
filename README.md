# Brawlhalla-Soundmod
Made by BakaByte

This Mod changes and adds additional Sound, giving each Legend a fitting voice Ingame.

Important: This mod won’t work once a new patch is out. Due to new sounds being added. I’ll try to update the mod ASAP!

I do not own the sounds used in this Mod and credit goes to the respective Creator!

Sounds used:

- League of Legends
- Skullgirls
- Smash 4
- Mortal Combat X
- Dead by Daylight
- Street fighter 5
